# üìÑ Description

This project consists of several exercises that work with file and directory manipulation in Java. The exercises are as follows:

- **Exercise 1:** Create a class that lists the contents of a directory received as a parameter in alphabetical order.
- **Exercise 2:** Add to the previous class the functionality to list a directory tree with the content of all its levels (recursively) so that it is printed on the screen in alphabetical order within each level, also indicating if it is a directory (D) or a file (F), and its last modification date.
- **Exercise 3:** Modify the previous exercise. Now, instead of displaying the result on the screen, save the output to a TXT file.
- **Exercise 4:** Add functionality to read any TXT file and display its content on the console.
- **Exercise 5:** The program must now serialize a Java object to a `.ser` file and then deserialize it.
